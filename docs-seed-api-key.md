# Seed API key into secrets map

> Seed the API key into the secrets map using the map-entry-set control call.

Your contract reads the API key from `z:<tid>:secrets` at runtime. There's no `set-credentials` function — the tenant SDK writes the key straight into the map with the `map-entry-set` control call, on the authenticated `tee:tenant/contracts` path (not an agent call).

```typescript theme={null}
await tenant.executeControl("map-entry-set", {
  map_name: tenant.canonicalName("secrets"),
  key:      "duffel_api_key",
  value:    process.env.DUFFEL_API_KEY!,
});

console.log("API key sealed in z:<tid>:secrets — not visible outside the TEE");
```

What happens:

1. `map-entry-set` writes the value into `z:<tid>:secrets`. It is a control-plane write, so it **bypasses the map's `writers` ACL** — the key lands even though the map is read/write-restricted to the contract alone (see [Create tenant KV maps](/developers/adk/tips/create-kv-maps)).
2. At call time your contract reads it back with `kv_store::get(&format!("z:{}:secrets", hex::encode(&tenant_did())), b"duffel_api_key")` inside the TDX enclave — `kv-store::get` takes the full canonical map name (not the bare tail) and a byte-string key.

The only path to the key is through your contract code — no external observer, not the agent, not the calling developer, can read it back out.
