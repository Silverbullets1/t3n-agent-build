# 3. Register your TEE contract

Registration uploads the WASM component you built in [Step 2](/developers/adk/get-started/walkthrough/build-contract) and gives it a tenant-local name. After this step, T3N knows about your contract and gives you a numeric `contract_id` that you use when creating map ACLs.

This code goes back in `quickstart.ts` — the Node/TypeScript project from Quickstart — not in the `z-tenant-flight` Rust repo. Append it to the bottom, after the `TenantClient` code from [Set Up Dev Env](/developers/adk/get-started/prerequisites/set-up-dev-env).

Before you run this code, make sure you have:

* An authenticated `TenantClient` named `tenant`. If you have not created one yet, complete [Quickstart](/developers/adk/get-started/quickstart) and [Set Up Dev Env](/developers/adk/get-started/prerequisites/set-up-dev-env) first.
* A compiled WASM file at `target/wasm32-wasip2/release/z_tenant_flight.wasm`, **inside the separate `z-tenant-flight` folder you cloned** in [Write your TEE contract](/developers/adk/get-started/walkthrough/write-contract) — not inside your Node project.
* Your `tenantDid`, for example `did:t3n:abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01`.

## Choose a contract tail

The `tail` is the local name of your contract inside your tenant namespace. Pass only the part after `z:<tid>:`. For example, the tail `travel-contracts` becomes:

```text theme={null}
z:<tid>:travel-contracts
```

Do not include `z:<tid>:` in the `tail`; the SDK and host derive that from the authenticated tenant.

A tail may contain letters, digits, `_`, `-`, and `.` — but **not** `/`. The SDK rejects slashes (`tail must match /^[a-zA-Z0-9_-][a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{0,127}$/`).

Pick a stable tail for each contract you plan to maintain. When you register a new build at the same tail, increase the `version` value; changing the tail creates a separate contract entry.

<Note>
  Keep tails short and simple (a few words, hyphen-separated) rather than long or descriptive. The full canonical name (`z:<tid>:<tail>`) gets reused downstream in places like delegation grants, and a handful of teams have hit unexpectedly-strict length limits further down the pipeline when using long tails. The 128-character limit above is enforced at registration; treat it as a ceiling, not a target.
</Note>

## Register the WASM

```typescript theme={null}
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";

// Path to the .wasm file INSIDE your cloned z-tenant-flight folder, relative
// to quickstart.ts. Adjust this if you cloned it somewhere else.
const WASM_PATH = "../z-tenant-flight/target/wasm32-wasip2/release/z_tenant_flight.wasm";
const CONTRACT_TAIL = "travel-contracts";
const CONTRACT_VERSION = "0.1.0";

const wasmBytes = await readFile(WASM_PATH);

const result = await tenant.contracts.register({
  tail: CONTRACT_TAIL,
  version: CONTRACT_VERSION,
  wasm: wasmBytes,
});

// This numeric ID is required in the next setup step when you create map ACLs.
const contractId = result.contract_id;
const tenantId = tenantDid.slice("did:t3n:".length);
const scriptName = `z:${tenantId}:${CONTRACT_TAIL}`;

console.log(`registered ${scriptName} as contract id ${contractId}`);
```

`WASM_PATH` above assumes you cloned `z-tenant-flight` as a sibling folder next to your Node project (i.e. `../z-tenant-flight/...` from `quickstart.ts`) — if you put it somewhere else, update the path accordingly.

<Note>
  Registration does not run your code, create maps, seed secrets, or grant outbound HTTP access. It only stores the component and records the versioned contract entry for your tenant.
</Note>

## What T3N stores

The register payload is just `{ tail, version, wasm }`; there is no manifest.

Host-side, T3N:

1. Stores the WASM blob in content-addressed storage.
2. Allocates a numeric `ContractId`.
3. Records the contract under your tenant registry.

Your contract's capabilities come from the host interfaces it imports in `world.wit`, not from this registration request. See [Capabilities come from your WIT imports](/developers/adk/tips/capabilities-from-wit-import).

Outbound hosts are also not declared here. They come from the calling user's authorization grant at invoke time. See [Outbound HTTP is authorized by the user, not the contract](/developers/adk/tips/outbound-http-auth-by-user).

<Warning>
  **Re-registering a tail allocates a new `contract_id`.** Unpinned calls resolve to the *latest* registered version (that's what `getContractVersion()` returns); if you need a specific version, pass it explicitly to `contracts.execute()` and it will be honored. The real gotcha is the id: there is currently no API to fetch a tail's current `contract_id` after re-registering, so if you created map ACLs scoped to the old `contract_id`, a re-registration can leave them pointing at a stale id. Keep a record of each `contract_id` your tenant registers so you can re-grant map access if needed.
</Warning>

The contract is now registered. It still cannot complete the full end-to-end flow until the [maps](/developers/adk/tips/create-kv-maps) and [secrets](/developers/adk/tips/seed-api-key) it reads at runtime exist.
